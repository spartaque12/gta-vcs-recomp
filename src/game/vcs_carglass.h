// A vehicle's glass not drawn (the in-car first-person view, game/vcs_firstperson.h): its windscreen, side and rear
// windows are left out of its draw while every other vehicle - and this one once hide(0) is called - is drawn as the
// game draws it.
//
// VCS has no glass atomics: a car's windows are meshes with a glass material (colour alpha below 255) inside its
// "chassis_hi", windscreen and door elements, and the materials are shared by every vehicle of the model (writing them
// would clear the glass of the parked twin too). Each mesh's material colour is handed to the VU by FUN_0039E7F0 from
// the element render (FUN_0039EC18 / FUN_0039E828) just before its draw; for the hidden vehicle's glass meshes the hook
// passes it on with alpha 0, so the alpha test leaves nothing of them. Nothing is written to the game's memory.
// Details and addresses: vcs_carglass.cpp. VCS_CARGLASS_HOOKS=0 hooks nothing (the reference).
