// Free aim (SA's manual aim; docs/CONTROLS.md, game-internals.md 12d): with a gun R1 (the right mouse button) no longer
// locks on. The camera goes over the player's right shoulder (first person keeps its own view), a dot crosshair marks the
// middle of the picture, the mouse / right stick aim, the player points his gun there and his shots go along the
// camera's line through the crosshair. Melee weapons keep the game's lock-on (as SA's fists), the sniper rifles and the
// rocket launcher their own sights.
//
// The game's parts (game-internals.md 12d):
// - lock-on: CPlayerPed::FindWeaponLockOnTarget (FUN_002d68c8, ProcessPlayerWeapon on R1) finds nothing for a gun.
// - the pose: CPed::AimGun (FUN_001f1438) points the gun at m_fLookDirection (+0x6B8), pitched by the player's +0xCAC,
//   while bIsAimingGun (+0x1C8 0x100) is set and he has no seek target (+0x450): CPed::SetAimFlag's writes
//   (FUN_001f1298) are made in every camera update of the aim, ClearAimFlag's (FUN_001f13d0) when it ends.
// - the shots: CWeapon::ProcessLineOfSight (FUN_002d0870) from FireInstantHit for the player gets the camera's line:
//   from the point of it nearest the muzzle, the weapon's range along it (as SA's Find3rdPersonCamTargetVector).
// - the camera: game/vcs_firstperson.cpp (its hook; look() turns the aim too).
// - drive-bys (SA's Manual Driveby Remake): the game's own (L2 / R2 + Circle with an SMG: CWeapon::FireFromCar
//   FUN_002c1bb0 -> FireInstantHitFromCar FUN_002cb7c0) - the camera over the vehicle (or first person's) aims and its
//   line carries the shots through the same hook (its line-of-sight call returning to 0x2CC850).
// VCS_FREEAIM=0|1 overrides the setting for one run.
